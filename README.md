# Ahungry Silent Hero

Gives the protagonist a chance to be a silent hero.

## Notes

I think I'll probably focus on any dialogue that is unskippable/forced
upon the player - if one wanted to be the silent protag for a
skippable npc, they can simply avoid talking to them.

Or I'll try to add a lot of silent options for the core game, and see
if the project catches on/inspires other mod authors to provide
similar agency for their protagonist vs more rail-roaded paths.
